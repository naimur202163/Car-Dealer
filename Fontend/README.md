# Car Dealer Website
## Project Description :
This website has a sleek design. It starts off with its simple but stylish landing page in a color scheme that radiates timelessness and sophistication. This website also has easy navigation, a great font style, and a clean navigation bar.
Smooth scrolling behaviour, yes! The graphics on this website are engaging and these present a friendly environment throughout the website. I also love the web design’s simplicity while having a “first-class” motif through their color choice.
